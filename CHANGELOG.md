# Changelog

## 7.1.1
- **FIX**(android): Resolve crop-drag conflicts with navigation gestures on android. This resolves issue [#303](https://github.com/hm21/pro_image_editor/issues/303)

## 7.1.0
- **FEAT**(Wasm): Replaced the `dart:html` and `dart:js` packages with `package:web` and `dart:js_interop` to enable WebAssembly (Wasm) support. 
The current Flutter version `3.27.1` has an open issue with the `ColorFiltered` widget. As a result, the tune and filter editor will not function in Wasm. Once Flutter resolves this issue, the editor should work without requiring further updates.

## 7.0.1
- **FIX**(zoom): Corrected the layer rotation calculation when the user drags the rotation button. This resolves issue [#266](https://github.com/hm21/pro_image_editor/issues/266)

## 7.0.0
### Changed
- **File Structure Update**:
  - Moved `custom widgets`, `icons`, and `theme` files into the `configs` directory for better organization.
  - Renamed all `theme` files to `styles` to better reflect their purpose.

### Breaking Changes
- File renaming and restructuring require updates to your configuration file:
  - `custom widgets`, `icons`, and `theme` files are now located directly in the `configs` directory of the editor.
  - All theme classes are renamed to end with `Style` for consistency.

  
For more details on why these breaking changes were made and what improvements they bring, check out that [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/hm21/pro_image_editor/discussions/298).
